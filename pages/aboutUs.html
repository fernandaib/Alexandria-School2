          <p class="p-l-5">Recognized by Newsweek as the top transformative high school in the nation for three years in a row, The Preuss School UC San Diego is a unique charter middle and high school for low income students who strive to become the first in their families to graduate from college. Located on the UC San Diego campus, our students come from throughout San Diego County to take advantage of an environment that encourages intellectual risk-taking while offering an array of academic supports.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Our graduates are consistently accepted to four-year colleges and universities at a rate of more than 90 percent, and almost 100 percent are going on to some form of higher education. Yet, we do more than prepare our students for higher education. We provide them with the skills necessary to effect change in society and help transform communities here in San Diego and throughout the world.</p>
